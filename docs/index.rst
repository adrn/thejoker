The Joker [YO-ker] /'joʊkər/
****************************

-----

The Joker is a custom Monte Carlo sampler for the two-body problem and is
therefore useful for constraining star-star or star-planet systems. It is
designed to generate posterior samples over the orbital parameters of the
primary (observed) star given time-domain radial velocity measurements of this
star. Though it is assumed the system has only a primary and a companion, The
Joker can also be used for hierarchical systems in which the velocity
perturbations from a third or other bodies are much longer than the dominant
companion. See `the paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.07602>`_ for more details
about the method and applications.
